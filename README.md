Welcome to Pavlo Naichuk GitHub page. Here you can find some of the projects I worked on in my spare time. 

<b>File Manager (Java (Swing))</b>  
Wrote application as a pad project, similar in functionality to Total Commander (http://www.ghisler.com). The application has a main window with left and right panels, allowing to acomplish the following commands:
- display file name, size, extension and last date of modification
- dynamically specify which file properties display in the table
- copy, move/rename, delete files and create a new folder
- navigate through file system
- open a file through an associated application

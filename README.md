Welcome to Pavlo Naichuk GitHub page. Here you can find some of the projects I worked on in my spare time. 

<b>Tic Tac Toe (C++)</b>  
Console version of a popular Tic Tac Toe game. 
The game allows player to select game mode: either play versus another player or PC.  
Keyboard settings:  
'1' - select "Player VS Player" mode  
'2' - select "Player VS PC" mode

<b>File Manager (Java (Swing))</b>  
Wrote application as a pad project, similar in functionality to Total Commander (http://www.ghisler.com).  
The application has a main window with left and right panels, allowing to acomplish the following commands:
- display file name, size, extension and last date of modification
- dynamically specify which file properties display in the table
- copy, move/rename, delete files and create a new folder
- navigate through file system
- open a file through an associated application

<b>Excel Exporter (Java (Swing), C#)</b>   
Wrote application as part of bachelor's thesis to export student grades to Excel file for printing. User interface was written in Java (Swing), which allowed to specify student grades and subjects. The export to Excel format was done by launching extra C# application from Java code by passing student data through the command line arguments.
